# PKU Meta-analysis Manuscript

To run the PKU meta-analysis, you must have [PyMC](http://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) version 2.1 (or greater) installed. PyMC, in turn, has several dependencies that are described in the [PyMC User's Guide](http://pymc-devs.github.com/pymc/).

The manuscript corresponding to this model was accepted for publication in the [Journal of Interited Metabolic Disease](http://www.springer.com/medicine/internal/journal/10545) in November, 2012.
